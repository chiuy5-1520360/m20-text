# Load booksinto a dataframe using the austen_books() function
book.df <- austen_books()

# How many books are in the dataset?
book.df %>% select(book) %>% unique() %>% nrow()

# Which book has the most lines?
book.frq <- book.df %>% select(book) %>% table() %>% data.frame() 
colnames(book.frq) <- c("book", "Freq")
book.frq %>% filter(Freq == max(Freq)) %>% select(book)

# Use the unnest_tokens function to generate the full list of words


# Which words are most common (regardless of which book them come from)?


# Remove stop words by performing an anti_join with the stop_words dataframe


# Which non stop-words are most common?


# Use ggplot to make a horizontal bar chart of the word frequencies of non-stop words
